# Hello 👋 $yourName.

This is a logging program for human brain, neuro-bridge lines, communicating directly with brain neuro-bridge. At the runtime, whatever you think about it will be a log gatherd from brain data at that exact time.  

_E.g. on runtime you think about your tech skills, brain will be bring out those neurons by sending electric pulse signals to them, then those neurons communicate with this program._


> [!WARNING]
> This program is under test and development. Forcing program to close unexpectedly may cause some damage to neuro-bridge lines in your brain. So, please use with caution and don't ever try to terminate program while your neuro-bridges are connected. This damage may cause your brain stop functionig correctly. 



## How To Run :

clone repo and build it. then :

```bash
./neuro-relay --port COMM02 --config /etc/brain/neurorc
```
